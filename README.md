# FinalYearProject

Repository for progress on my capstone undergraduate project in theoretical physics in University College Dublin. This project, under the supervision of Prof. Niels Warburton in the School of Applied and Computational Mathematics, initially aims to study the dynamics and frequencies of zoom-whirl orbits of test masses around black holes in Kerr spacetime. Extensions to the goals will be proposed over the course of the year.

Thus far, test mass orbits have been modelled in Schwarzschild geometry by numerical integration of both the Euler-Lagrange equations and the geodesic equation, with perfect agreement between timelike paths found by both. 2D zoom-whirl behaviour was observed as expected in the correct parameter ranges (close to the separatrix in eccentricity-semi latus rectum phase space). Out of curiosity, these notebooks were extended and now may also be used to model null paths near the black hole.

Current work is focusing on calculating the radial and azimuthal frequencies of the orbits for different parameters, and on extending the simulation to Kerr spacetime for rotating black holes, resulting in motion outside the equatorial plane.
